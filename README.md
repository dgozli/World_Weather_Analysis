# World_Weather_Analysis

## Purpose of the project 

The purpose of this project was to use Google Map API, to sample a set of 2,000 locations around the world, find cities and hotels near them, filter cities based on weather preferences, and generate an itinerary based on a set of four locations (in my case, I selected four cities in Canada). 

## Resources

We used Open Weather API, Google API, citipy, and other Python libraries (Pandas, NumPy, etc.)
